# SwiftApi v2.0 is going [Sponge](http://spongepowered.org)!
Because Bukkit is dead (greatly timed, exactly when SwiftApi v2.0.0 was done) v2.0.0 will be re-written for Sponge. Sponge 
is the new Minecraft modding API taking Bukkit's place. Combining the strengths of the server and client modding, i'm certain Sponge is the way forward.
  
  
I have been keeping track of Sponge's development, and they've [just released API v1.0](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/status-update-api-release-edition/4889). 
This means i'll slowly start converting SwiftApi v2 to the Sponge platform. The same goes for Apache Thrift, they've just released v0.9.2 which allows multiplexing.
Because of extendability was decided to use in v2 even though at that time Thrift 0.9.2 was still in development. Hence the SwiftApi v2 release was stalled, and never got passed Alpha with Bukkit going awol.

Keep an eye on the repository and this page, i'll be updating it soon with release info. For now **all text below here is for the old v1.7 Bukkit version**.
